# About TRIST

TRIST is a Proof Of Concept (PoC) Cyber Physcial System (CPS) testbed to evaluate the usefulness of containerised environments for CPS simulation.

Currently, TRIST enables the development of virtual, instantly deployable Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) which can be used to develop and test datasets.

TRIST is funded by [UWEcyber](http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~pa-legg/uwecyber/) (thanks [UWE](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/)!)

# Technologies and features

TRIST is an open-source CPS Threat Research and Intelligence Sharing Testbed (TRIST).
TRIST aims to make CPS simulation and dataset development easy by providing the following features:

- CPS development and deployment
- CPS dataset development and testing

TRIST is deployed in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to offer the containerised environment.

TRIST is part inspired by [MiniCPS](https://minicps.readthedocs.io/), a CPS simulation tool built on top of [Mininet](http://mininet.org/). However, TRIST takes this one step further by implementing any CPS into portable and instantly deployable Docker containers. This means no installation, configuration, or setup is requried.

# Current state

TRIST is a Work In Progress (WIP) and so some functionality and features will be incomplete or buggy.

When the simulation is started, TRIST automatically begins to collect data generated by each component. This can be found in the "datasets" directory.

## Current simulations

There are two PoC simulations available to use. Each one is seperated on each branch in the repo:

- [main](https://github.com/RedClouud/ICS-test-bed-PoC) - the main branch contains the simulation running normally
- [DoS_Emulation](https://github.com/RedClouud/ICS-test-bed-PoC/tree/DoS_Emulation) - the DoS_Emulation branch contains an emulated DoS attack on PLC1 to mimic what DoS attack might look like on the system

## How to run the PoC

1. Select the branch that you would like to use: provides chosen feature

   ```bash
   $ git branch DoS_Emulation
   ```

2. Execute reset.sh: prepares environment

   ```bash
   $ ./reset.sh
   ```

   Note that you may need make reset.sh executable using the following command:

   ```bash
   $ chmod +x reset.sh
   ```

3. Execute the docker-compose file: creates containers and begins simulation and data collection

   ```bash
   $ cd TRIST
   $ docker-compose up -d
   ```

You should now have six containers running:

- plc[1 - 3]-1: PLCs to control physical processes
- t[1 | 3]01-1: water tanks to simulate physical processes
- data-collector-1: data collector to collect logs into `datasets`

You can stop the simulation using `$ docker-compose down`
